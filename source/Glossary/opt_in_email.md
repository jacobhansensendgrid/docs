**Opt-in email** refers to bulk email, such as a newsletter or advertisement, that is sent out to a mailing list where every member of that list has actively given you permission to send them email. Without obtaining this permission, your email is likely to be viewed as unwanted or unsolicited, and is liable to be marked as [spam]({{root_url}}/Glossary/spam.html) by the recipient or be “bulked” by the receiving mailbox provider (i.e. delivered directly to the spam folder).

It is important to note that the method through which an email address is collected is often the first impression the recipient will have of the sender. If done well, it can help to reduce spam complaints and increase engagement (opens and clicks).

There are several variations of opt-in email:

- **Single Opt-in** refers to the practice of requesting your recipient’s permission to send them email during, and only during, registration.

- **Passive Opt-in** refers to the practice of requesting your recipient’s permission to send them email and then removing their email address from your list if they don't engage with a set number of messages within a set time frame (i.e. remove the address if they don't engage with one of the first 3 messages sent within the first 7 days).

- **Double Opt-in** refers to the practice of requesting your recipient's permission to send them email twice. For example, you could ask them if they want to receive your email at registration, and then send another email asking them to confirm their permission again.

- **Confirmed Opt-in** refers to the practice of sending confirmation emails to your recipients asking them to confirm their continued interest in receiving your future emails. This is similar to double opt-in.

Giving your recipients the option to opt-in to receive your email will help to improve your [sender reputation]({{root_url}}/Glossary/sender_reputation.html) and, depending on how strict your opt-in policy is, it can prevent your emails from ending up in your recipients’ [spam folders]({{root_url}}/Glossary/bulk_mail_folder.html).

Regardless of your method of obtaining a recipient's permission, it is important to give them the option of **opting-out** of receiving your future emails by including an [unsubscribe link]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Suppressions/index.html).

[CAN-SPAM]({{root_url}}/Glossary/can_spam.html) requires an opt-out option in all commercial emails, but it’s good practice to provide it in any email to your recipients. CAN-SPAM requires all senders to immediately honor an opt-out request submitted by a recipient.

[CASL](https://sendgrid.com/blog/casl-checklists/) is Canadian legislation that requires a sender to record the method through which a recipient agreed to receive messages from a sender. It also has requirements around how long a sender may send to an address based on how the address was collected.
